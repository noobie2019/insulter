# Insulter

Truly the Stink of Excellence in a world gone tits up

Insulter was created by me from assets I blatantly nicked from [Modern Toss's Periodic Table of Sweaing](https://ptos.moderntoss.com) which has been making me fucking laugh for years

## Features

- react audio
- react-flash animation
- redux

## Usage

- Copy the SwearMachine directory to somewhere in your existing React app or use [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to start a new one

- You'll need some dependencies if you do not already have them

```
cd <project-directory>
yarn add @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons react-redux history @reduxjs/toolkit
